# AI Integration Spec for Smart Tab Manager

## Overview
Integrate Kiro AI to make tab categorization even smarter by analyzing page content, user behavior patterns, and contextual information.

## Current State
- Basic keyword matching and domain-based categorization
- User training through click feedback
- Time-based context awareness

## Proposed AI Enhancements

### 1. Content Analysis
- **Goal**: Analyze actual page content, not just titles/URLs
- **Implementation**: Use content script to extract page text, headings, meta tags
- **AI Task**: Classify content type (work, entertainment, shopping, news, etc.)

### 2. Behavioral Pattern Recognition  
- **Goal**: Learn from user's browsing patterns
- **Data**: Time spent on tabs, switching frequency, engagement metrics
- **AI Task**: Identify which types of content user actually uses vs. leaves idle

### 3. Smart Notifications
- **Goal**: Proactive suggestions based on usage patterns
- **Examples**: 
  - "You have 5 YouTube tabs open for 2+ hours, close them?"
  - "Work hours starting, focus mode available?"
  - "You usually close Reddit tabs after 10 minutes, close now?"

### 4. Context-Aware Categorization
- **Goal**: Same site can be work or personal based on context
- **Examples**:
  - GitHub during work hours = important
  - GitHub at night = hobby (less important)
  - YouTube tutorials = important, YouTube entertainment = useless

## Implementation Plan
1. Enhance content script to gather more data
2. Create AI prompts for content classification
3. Build behavioral analytics
4. Add smart notification system
5. Test and refine with real usage data

## Success Metrics
- Improved categorization accuracy (user corrections decrease)
- User satisfaction with suggestions
- Reduced manual training needed
