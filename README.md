## 🤖 How the Advanced AI Works

### 🧠 **Multi-Layer Intelligence System**
- **Domain Recognition** - 50+ hardcoded patterns for instant categorization

### 🎯 **Smart Categorization Examples**
```javascript
// Priority Detection
GitHub + "documentation" + work hours = 🔥 Priority
Gmail + active engagement = 🔥 Priority

// Time-Sink Detection  
YouTube + 10+ minutes active + work hours = ⏰ Time-Sink
Reddit + multiple visits + comments section = ⏰ Time-Sink

// Research Detection
Medium + "tutorial" + long content = 📥 Research
Wikipedia + multiple headings = 📥 Research

// Zombie Detection
Any tab unused for 7+ days = 🗑️ Zombie
```
